# VocabularyCracker

Vocabulary Cracker is a program that will run silently in the background of your computer, reading your keypresses, monitoring your typing habits, and storing that information locally on your device. 

This information can then be read from and visualised in the frontend desktop application (Separate from the background process) which will allow you to configure the background process and set preferences.
